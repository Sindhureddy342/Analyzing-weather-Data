# Analyzing-weather-Data
This project involves analyzing daily weather data to uncover insights such as temperature patterns, rainfall trends, and relationships between different weather features. Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, To perform data exploration, visualization, and correlation analysis. 


Project Title: Weather Data Analysis

Objective:  
This project analyzes weather data to identify patterns in temperature, rainfall, and humidity. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling.

Dataset:  
The 'weather.csv' dataset contains daily weather information such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed.

Data Exploration:  
The dataset is explored for structure, missing values, and basic statistics to identify any anomalies or outliers.

Data Visualization:  
Visualizations like pair plots and histograms are used to examine relationships between variables like temperature and rainfall.

Feature Engineering:  
New features are created from available data, such as monthly averages, to provide more insight into weather patterns.

Predictive Modeling:  
A linear regression model is used to predict rainfall, with the model's performance evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Insights and Conclusions:  
The analysis identifies trends, such as the months with the highest rainfall, and explores relationships between weather variables.

Future Work:  
Future analysis could include advanced machine learning models, additional weather features, and multi-year data for long-term trends.

Tools and Technologies:  
Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for predictive modeling.

Conclusion:  
The project provides insights into weather trends and relationships, laying the groundwork for more advanced weather prediction models.
